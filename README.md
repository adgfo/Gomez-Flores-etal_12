# Flotation separation of lithium-ion battery electrodes predicted by a long short-term memory network using data from physicochemical kinetic simulations and experiments

This repository provides relevant files referenced in **[our paper](https://dashing-nubian-spitting-cobra.anacondaapps.cloud/)** (link will be updated when the paper is published). Feel free to use the files, but please acknowledge their source by citing this repository and/or the paper.
The repository includes three folders: **databases**, **LSTM**, and **web-application**.

## databases

*The two databases used in the paper are provided in this folder.*

The two databases are Gomez-Flores_et_al_Database1.csv (training and testing database) and Gomez-Flores_et_al_Database2.csv (validation database).

## LSTM

*A code for the machine learning model is provided in this folder.* The machine learning model is a deep **long short-term memory (LSTM)** neural network.

The code includes package versions, database loading, database scaling, LSTM setting up, and prediction.

## web-application

*The link to access the free web app of the Flotation Module is provided in this folder.*

This folder also contains trained scalers, trained machine learning model, and images used in the web app.
